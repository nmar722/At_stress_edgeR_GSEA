## EdgeR analysis of RNAseq data of Arabidopsis stress experiment

The RNAseq count data from transcription profiling experiment by high throughput sequencing of Arabidopsis plants in response to a combination of salt and heat stress have been downloaded from [Expression Atlas website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-GEOD-72806/Downloads).
