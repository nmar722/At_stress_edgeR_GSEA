## Transcript analysis of Arabidopsis plants under heat and salt stresses

The RNAseq count data from transcription profiling experiment by high throughput 
sequencing of Arabidopsis plants in response to a combination of salt and heat
stress have been downloaded from [Expression Atlas website](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-GEOD-72806/Downloads).
